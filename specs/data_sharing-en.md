# Uploading data from ProteGO to the server

Identifiers of other devices on which the application is also installed and which are located nearby are collected and stored locally (on the device) by ProteGO. The identifiers are randomly generated, they change every hour and hence do not reveal the identities of the owners of nearby devices. ProteGO stores information on the nearby devices for the last 2 weeks. Older data is deleted on an ongoing basis.

Upon identification of a new infected case, employees of the Polish Chief Sanitary Inspectorate (Główny Inspektor Sanitarny, GIS) or the Polish Central Registry of Infections (CRZ) send a request to every newly identified patient. Messages are sent to every newly identified patient, as it is not known who uses the application and who does not.

``` If you are ProteGO user, please send information about people who were nearby to warn them of possible infection. Nobody will know about your illness. Open ProteGO, select About application -> Send data. Please insert the code 1234-5678 and confirm. Thank you.```'

After sending the patient's data, the GIS / CRZ employee has access to a 2-week history of all users who were near the infected person. Each user is represented by a random, anonymous identifier. For each user (ID) who was nearby, he can see dates, frequency of contacts and signal strength (proximity). On this basis, the employee decides which users to change the status.

The employee can also decide that one of the non-anonymous users should be contacted using their known mobile phone number, e.g. by sending an SMS or by making an automatic phone call.

The above process can be (semi) automated over time.
